## Data structures
All the data is in a [single file](/data/data.json). Working on separate bits and pasting them in the correct place is risky, but it avoids working with nested structures and keeps to CSV to JSON (and back) straightforward.

### Year data
The year data sits at the top of each year. This controls the year totals and the bar chart.

| |  |
|----------|----------|
| year | 2015 |
| total-executions | 1,998+ |
| total-death-sentences | 1,634+ |
| ABOLITIONIST | 102 |
| ABOLITIONIST FOR ORDINARY CRIMES | 6 |
| ABOLITIONIST IN PRACTICE | 52 |
| RETENTIONIST | 28 |
| countries | [_here is a new array with the country data for this year_] |

### Country data
Each country is an object with the countries array for that year. All countries that need to be active (i.e. press for detailbox) need to be in this array.

* The id (ISO3) is necessary to reference to correct geo data from world-topo.json. * The country name is references the country name translation in the dictionary file (lang/dictionary.json)
* The country name in data.json is in CAPS to indicate that it is not actually the country name but a reference to the key for translation. It must match the translation key in dictionary.json. If you want to change a country name in any language you need to do it in the dictionary file (lang/dictionary.json).
* Don’t ever change anything in CAPS - that indicates it’s a reference rather than the actual value. If in doubt, please double check.
* Putting a "O" in either executions or death-penalties will show the box with O. If you don't want it show - for abolitionist countries - leave it empty, e.g ""
* "Since" is the year an abolitionist country abolished the death penalty. "Status" is must match one of the four statuses outlined above.

| |  |
|----------|----------|
| id              | IRQ          |
| name            | Iraq         |
| since           |              |
| executions      | 26+          |
| death-penalties | 89+          |
| status          | RETENTIONIST |

### Languages
The languages come from a [language file](/lang/dictionary.json) which includes the translations for all the terms in the application. This approach keeps the data clean and avoids duplication.

To set the language add the language code in a variable in the embed url. Supported languages are ['ar', 'en', 'es', 'fr', 'zh_Hans','zh_Hant', 'zh_TW']. If it is not recognised, it will default to English.

To set the application to Arabic, for example, add `?lang=ar` to the end of the url.

Dictionary.getTranslation() looks for a translation in lang/dictionary.json and if it doesn’t find a translation for the provided key and language, it just returns the key instead of the translation. This allows us to translate 1,000s in the DP and execution figures.

To deal with the need for a Chinese symbol after "since" we have added a new dictionary entry with a key like "SINCE_SUFFIX", with the Chinese symbol as the Chinese translation, and a blank string for all other languages.

## iframe-resizer
iframe-resizer is a way to embed an iframe whose aspect ratio changes at different screen widths.

See https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer for documentation.

An example of iframe-resizer usage is in [iframe-resizer.html](/iframe-resizer.html)

## Updates
We're leveraging Github's functionality as much as possible. The live version sits in the gh-pages branch. To keep the data clean and not re-introduce errors it's important to pull before pushing (for yearly updates)

## NOTE: the gh-pages branch is the live version. Any edits in this branch will be published immediately.

## Editing workflow - small edits
Small edits can be done in Github using a Github account. If it's a tiny change and you are confident about making it, you can work directly in gh-pages. If not, you can create a new branch when you save it and then merge it into gh-pages once you are happy using a pull request.

1. Log in to Github
2. Make sure you are working in the correct branch. gh-pages is the live branch. If you're not sure, you can make a new branch from the gh-pages one and then merge your changes into gh-pages once you have previewed them.
3. Go to the [data file](/data/data.json)
4. Click on the pencil in the top right
5. Make the edit
6. Save the edit - add a commit message and save in the current branch (see point 2 above for details about branches).
7. You can preview the changes made in the your branch using this url and adding the correct branch name where is says BRANCH-NAME: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/wearethoughtfox/amnesty-dp-2016/blob/BRANCH-NAME/index.html

## Editing workflow - yearly updates
Two files are necessary for yearly updates. One for the year data and one for the country data. Pass these CSVs to a developer who can integrate them and update the timeline for an extra year.

Each year is in a separate sheet. Some things to watch out for:

1. Make sure the extra columns are empty.
2. Make sure the year is text (Select, right click, Format cells, text)
3. Make sure when save as CSV to "edit filter settings" and "quote all text cells"
4. http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm
5. Double check everything once it is imported
6. Export the data from json to csv if someone wants to work in a spreadsheet. This will avoid re-introducing errors that have been fixed.

## "Rolling" the topojson

1. Downloaded [Natural Earth shapefiles](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/)
2. Transform the shapefiles into geojson removing Antarctica: `ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -where "SU_A3 <> 'ATA'" world.json ne_50m_admin_0_countries/ne_50m_admin_0_countries.shp`
3. Transform the geojson into topojson: `topojson --id-property iso_a3 -p name -o world-topo.json world.json`
4. The object name in the topojson file needs to match the name in our JavaScript file, in this case "countries".
5. Note that for the border changes I have used https://mapshaper.org/. This allows you to make all of the same changes in the browser and doesn't require any software to be installed
6. The resulting file using mapshaper is a bit larger, 700kb. We could go smaller by doing the same process using the lower resolution (1:110m) or higher by using the higher resolution (1:10m).

## Fixes disputed territories process
### Get the two shapefiles into a separate geojson file
ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -where "name IN ('Golan Heights', 'Western Sahara')" disputed.json ne_50m_admin_0_breakaway_disputed_areas/ne_50m_admin_0_breakaway_disputed_areas.shp

### Get the two shapefiles into a separate geojson file
Merge Western Sahara and Morocco together in single polygon  
iso_a3 - ESH  
iso_a3 - MAR  
Include Western Sahara from disputed territory dataset  
name="Western Sahara"  
Dotted line for border  

Merge Somaliland and Somalia together into single polygon  
iso_a3 - -99 at the moment  - SOL  
iso_a3 - SOM  
Dotted line for Somaliland has been removed

Include Golan Heights from disputed territory  
name="Golan Heights"  
Dotted line for border

Kosovo and Serbia have no longer been merged
